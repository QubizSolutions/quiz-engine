# Coding guidelines

## Global guidelines(these do not apply to Javascript)
  * Pascal case for class and method names
  * Camel case for local variables, parameters and private variables
  * Dependency injected variables should be declared as ***private readonly*** and the constructor parameter should have the same name as the variable. Use **this** for variable assignment inside the constructor
  * When checking if a **Nullable< T >** has a value assigned, use **Nullable< T >.HasValue**
  * Use the **AutoMapper** extensions,  **.DeepCopyTo< T >** and **Map(source, dest)**, whenever possible to streamline the flow. This implies having the same property names on both objects which in fact is a must where possible

## Layer guide lines(this applies to each layer of the application)
  * Each layer should **accept** and **return** its own ***data types***


## Repository guidelines
  * Repository method naming conventions are as follows(try and follow them as much as possible, exceptions might occur):
  
    * **List**: When listing a collection of object. Append the filter name if applied(Ex: ***ListByAdmin***, ***ListByType***, ***ListByAdminAndType***)

    ``` c#
    public interface IFoo
    {
        Foo[] List();
        Foo[] ListByAdmin(Guid adminID);
        Foo[] ListByType(FooType type);
        Foo[] ListByAdminAndType(Guid adminID, FooType type);
    }
    ```

    * **Get**: When listing a single object. Append the filter name if applied(Ex: ***GetByID***, ***GetByAdmin***, ***GetByType***, ***GetByAdminAndType***)

    ``` c#
    public interface IFoo
    {
        Foo GetByID(Guid id);
        Foo GetByAdmin(Guid adminID);
        Foo GetByType(FooType type);
        Foo GetByAdminAndType(Guid adminID, FooType type);
    }
    ```

    * **Delete**: When deleting object(s). Append the filter name if applied(Ex: ***DeleteByID***, ***DeleteByAdmin***, ***DeleteByType***, ***DeleteByAdminAndType***)

    ``` c#
    public interface IFoo
    {
        void DeleteByID(Guid id);
        void DeleteByAdmin(Guid adminID);
        void DeleteByType(FooType type);
        void DeleteByAdminAndType(Guid adminID, FooType type);
    }
    ```

## Unit and integration testing guidelines
Examples contain references to [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq4) which is the most popular and friendly mocking framework for .NET

  * Individual tests should follow the naming convention of ***TestMethod_WhenScenario_ThenExpectedResult*** and be as descriptive as possible

    ``` c#
    [TestMethod]
    public void Create_WhenDuplicateName_ThenReturnsError()
    {
        // test method body
    }
    ```
  
  * Never use **DateTime.Now** in a test, always declare your own ***DateTime*** using the year, month, day or other parts if needed

    ``` c#
    [TestMethod]
    public void Some_Test_Method()
    {
        // lets say the DateTime.Now is equal to new DateTime(2010, 01, 01)
        DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
        
        DateTime birthDate = new DateTime(1980, 01, 01);
        
        int age = bar.Age(birthDate, now);
        
        // If we run this today, we get proper results
        // If we run this after a period of time, lets say a year,
        // it's gonna fail misserably since is going to see that the age went
        // up a notch which is perfectly correct, 'now' is going to be new DateTime(2011, 01, 01)
    }
    ```
  
  * Keep unit tests small, test **ONLY ONE** specific scenario. Try not to test the same thing multiple times. Unit tests should be quick to write and easy to maintain
  * Mocking should be used where possible so that only the specific code being tested needs to be executed
  * Mocked objects should reflect as much as possible what the real object would return
  * Every mocked object should be prefixed with **Mock** and declared as a ***private field***
  * Use **MockBehavior.Strict** whenever possible and verify them all at the end of each test
  * Always use the TestInitialize and TestCleanup methods to instantiate mocked objects and the tested object and respectively verify all mocks

    ``` c#
    [TestClass]
    public class FooTest
    {
        private Mock<IBar> barMock;
        
        private Foo foo;
    
        [TestInitialize]
        public void TestInitialize()
        {
            barMock = new Mock<IBar>(MockBehavior.Strict);
            
            foo = new Foo(barMock.Object);
        }
        
        [TestCleanup]
        public void TestCleanup()
        {
            barMock.VerifyAll();
        }
    }
    ```
